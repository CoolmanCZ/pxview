What is pxlib ?
---------------

pxlib is shared C library to read various Paradox files. Currently .DB
files are best supported. pxlib provides a very simple api to read the
header and the data records of Paradox files. I also provides functions
to convert the data into the hosts data format (little or big endian).

The complete api is well documented in set of man pages, one for each
function.

pxlib can be downloaded at http://pxlib.sourceforge.net.
